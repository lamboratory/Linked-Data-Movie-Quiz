The Linked Data Movie Quiz (LDMQ) is a questions game about cinema generated by accessing the Linked Movie Data Base by SPARQL.

The LDMQ was presented to the 10K Apart contest, where web apps had to be developed in less than 10 kilobytes. The code is client-side and access to the SPARQL endpoint is done directly from the browser through the YQL platform.
